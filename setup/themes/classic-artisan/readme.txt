== Description ==

Classic Artisan features a modern expression of a timeless design with a traditional layout meeting bold typography, high contrast, and an elegant background.

Ideal for artists, designers, craftspeople, or small businesses, Classic Artisan showcases and adapts to your brand. It minimizes clutter and works great for smaller sites, helping you leave an impression on your visitors without excessive complexity.

With a featured home page video or image header, a custom logo, custom color options, featured images, and a menu and widget area, you can make Classic Artisan your own quickly and easily. The sophisticated background texture is a highly-customizable canvas of tiled colors that's unique on every page view.
